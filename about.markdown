So... Where to start? Well the beginning is a good start. During the First-Wave of lockdowns due to the dreaded virus which no one is aloud to say online without some form of backlash for some reason, talk about taking freedom of speech away from people, but then agian its probabbly fair some people have been taking it just a little to far. Oh well enough about that more about us, during the lockdown... We decided to look into 3D printing, mainly as a starting guide into helping my partner enter the work force for the first time in her lifetime. We settled with a Snapmaker 2.0 which at the time was was a pre production product on kickstarter. 

The Snapmaker 2.0 is a 3-in-1 machine, for anyone who don't know what this machine is or does we suggest to check their website as it really does show them better than we could ever explain it. From 3D printing, to CNC Milling. They also do laser work but based on the experience you would want the 10W version of the laser or you will be very disapointed. It was quite the learning curve, from no machining experience at all to now being able to 3D Print, Laser Cut/Engrave and last but not least and the most fassinating CNC Milling, notice we said milling not machining.

Our experience may be limited with the buisness side, however it will only get better, the more work we do the better we will become which is why we feel that we should have a different buisness approach, instead of trying to be the #1 or the top company in our field. That would be great but you can't just wake up and think that, you have to start, grind, sweat and bleed to get there so our motto/company slogan
